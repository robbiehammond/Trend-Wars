Critical:
    1. Finish game functionality on frontend and ensure all required backend communication is sent to frontend (definitely priority number 1)
        - Def gonna be the most difficult and time-consuming of everything on this list, since there's going to be a number of edge cases to deal with on both the frontend and backend 
            - players leaving mid game, in the case of a 429 error from trends, etc 
    2. Fix major bugs/implement missing functionality on frontend/backend
        - Make it such that new players joining/players leaving lobby is updated on frontend 
        - Many others 
    3. Have filtered list of starting words
        - At least 500 words or so? 
        - Implement backend functionality to randomly choose one 
    4. The turn timer
        - Must be non-blocking, i.e. server cannot be halted while counting the timer down
    5. Test code to figure out what bugs are in the frontend/backend, fix those bugs 
    6. Get code onto server 
        - Mostly a straightforward process


Nice to have, but not essentially:
    1. Profile system
        - Will almost certainly require a decent bit of time and effort if we want use a database my MySQL 
            - Making the DB is easy, communicating with it can be a bit of a headache
        - In addition, it'll require the creation of login + create account + view account pages on the frontend 
        - A decent bit of backend code will have to be written so that the frontend can effectively communicate with the database
            - frontend cannot (easily) directly communicate with DB, frontend will have to send messages to backend and then the backend will make queries and in turn send info to frontend
            - https://github.com/CSDS341Project/Subscription-Management-System/blob/main/backend/main.py, DB communication code would probably look something like this
    2. Make it such that when an invalid lobbyID is typed in as the URL, an error page appears 
    3. An automated testing suite (i.e. unit tests)
    4. Add more cosmetic visuals to frontend
