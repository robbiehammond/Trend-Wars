    - Actually make socket connections n stuff work seamlessly (4/5 difficulty) (Robbie)

    - Add a turn timer that still allows the server to process events (so you can't just sleep the whole thing) (2/5 difficulty) (Saketh, Charlie)
    - Use the Trends API to rank words (2/5 difficulty) (Michael, Tyler)
    - Be able to generate starting words that work well (2/5 difficulty) (Saketh, Michael, Tyler, Charlie)
